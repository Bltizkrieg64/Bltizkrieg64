- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Bltizkrieg64
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating a visual novel while learning Python3.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working towards a Bachelors of Computer Science.

- I have written out the first few scenes of a visual novel using RenPy and it has been an interesting experience.
- I have also worked with Unity for programming video games and as a result have learned some C#.
